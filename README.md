### Physically-Inspired Light Streak Filter


![Light Streaks](https://i.imgur.com/Ww8H2lx.jpg)


This effect is based on the process of bright light scattering through the lens elements of a camera. The light streaks are generated at small apertures (lens opening) where the number/shape of streaks depends on the aperture blades and blade shape of the lens respectively.

### Getting Started

> **NOTE:**
It is highly recommended that you use this with HDR, a Tonemapper of your liking, and Linear Color Space.

Simply place [Insert Script Name] onto your camera, configure the settings as shown below as you wish.

#### Settings
------

| Setting       | Description   |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Quality      | Self-explanatory |
| Streaks      | Number of streaks rendered      |
| Power | Exponential strength of the effect      |
| Strength      | Intensity of the effect |
| Threshold      | Selectively choose which pixels render streaks based on brightness      |
| Attenuation | How quickly to fade away streak intensity from the bright pixel      |
| Angle      | Rotation angle of the streak filter |
| Diffraction      | How much light bends from lens source      |
| Rotate based on camera | Camera rotations cause the angle to change?  |
| Spectrum Texture      | Diffraction modulation texture |
